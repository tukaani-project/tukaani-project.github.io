		<h1>The .xz file format</h1>

<div class="tab">
	<p>
		The .xz file format is a container format for compressed streams.
		There are no archiving capabilities, that is, the .xz format can hold
		only a single file just like the .gz and .bz2 file formats used by
		gzip and bzip2, respectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		Compared to a few other popular stream compression formats, the .xz format
		provides a few advanced features. At the same time, it has been kept
		simple enough to be usable in many embedded systems.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="dark-block">
	<h2>Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Streamable:</strong> It is always possible to create and
			decompress .xz files in a pipe; no seeking is required.</li>
		<li><strong>Random-access reading:</strong> The data can be split
			into independently compressed blocks. Every .xz file contains
			an index of the blocks, which makes limited random-access reading
			possible when the block size is small enough.</li>
		<li><strong>Multiple filters (algorithms):</strong> It is possible
			to add support for new filters, so no new file format is needed
			every time a new algorithm has been developed. Developers can use
			a developer-specific filter ID space for experimental filters.</li>
		<li><strong>Filter chaining:</strong> Up to four filters can
			be chained, which is very similar to piping on the UN*X
			command line. Chaining can improve compression ratio with some
			file types. Different filter chain can be used for every
			independently compressed block.</li>
		<li><strong>Integrity checks:</strong> Integrity of all headers
			is always protected with CRC32. The integrity of the actual data may
			be verified with CRC32, CRC64, SHA-256, or the check may be omitted
			completely. It is possible to add new integrity checks in future,
			but there is no possibility for developer-specific check IDs like
			there is for filter IDs.</li>
		<li><strong>Concatenation:</strong> Just like with .gz and .bz2
			files, .xz files can be concatenated. A decompressor can
			handle a concatenated file as if it was a regular
			single-stream .xz file.</li>
		<li><strong>Padding:</strong> Binary zeros may be appended to .xz
			files to pad them to fill e.g. a block on a backup tape. Padding
			must be a multiple of four bytes, because the size of a valid
			.xz file is always a multiple of four bytes.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="tab">
	<p>
		Once a new filter or integrity check has been added to the .xz file format
		specification, it won't be removed. This ensures that all .xz files
		that use only the filters defined in the .xz file format specification can
		always be decompressed in future.
	</p>

	<p>
		New filters, integrity checks, or other additions to the .xz file format are
		unlikely to occur very often. New filters are only added to the official list
		when they are clearly useful.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently, the only compression algorithm supported by the .xz file
		format is LZMA2. The other existing filters do not change the size of
		the data, but instead can increase the redundency of the stream.
		LZMA2 is a container format that improves upon LZMA in the following ways:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Data chunks (up to 2 MiB of uncompressed data or 64K KiB
			of compressed data) can be stored uncompressed. This improves
			compression on streams with incompressible parts and limits the
			possible inflation of the stream when none of the data is
			compressible.
		</li>
		<li>
			The encoder settings and dictionary can be reset between data
			chunks. This can improve compression in files with different
			types of data.
		</li>
		<li>
			Allows for mulithreaded encoding or decoding.
		</li>
	</ul>
